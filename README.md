This program stores and organizes your code snippets for any programming language with its easy to use features. I originally built this snippet manager because I didnâ€™t like the ones I saw on the Internet, so I decided to make my own. Code Librarian is very useful for people who are starting out in programming and for advanced programmers who need a place to store their code snippets for future reuse. The program was also designed to work with teams and with third-party code where crediting information will need to be saved.
