This program stores and organizes your code snippets for most programming language with its easy to use features. I drew inspiration from the original Snippet Manager by Richard Gardner which was lacking a few features, so I decided to make my own version. Snippet Manager is very useful for people who are starting out in programming and for advanced programmers who need a place to store their code snippets for future reuse.
